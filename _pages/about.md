I am an ECE(Robotics) M.S. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I graduated with a B.E. in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University. I am currently working at ITCA(Isuzu Technical Center of America) as a PVRD Intern, integrating the state of art perception and localization algorithms into trucks. During my undergraduate study, I worked at Zhejiang University IV Lab with Professor Jianke Zhu from 2018 to 2019, developing 3D semantic mapping by combining Mask R-CNN with the traditional SLAM algorithm. Besides, I participated in a worldwide Robotics Competition named RoboMaster in 2016, 2018, and 2019, in which I was the leader of the HERO(a robot name) team, responsible for the electronic system of that robot. I am interested in Robot/Automobile related works, especially Robot Perception.
