I am a ECE(Robotics) MS student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I graduated with a BS in Information Engineering from Zhejiang University. I worked at Zhejiang University IV Lab with Professor Jianke Zhu from 2018 to 2019, developing 3D semantic mapping by combining Mask R-CNN with traditional SLAM algorithm. In addition, I participated in a worldwide Robotics Competition named RoboMaster for almost four years during my undergraduate study and I was leader of the HERO(a robot name) team, responsible for the electronic system and the visual tracking system of that robot. I am interested in Robot/Automobile related works, especially Robot Perception.
