- Description: In the Robormaster 2018 Competition, I was working in a multidisciplinary team, which consist 30 students from different majors, like computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, management, etc. During this competition, I was the leader of robot HERO team, mainly responsible for the electronic system of the robot. Meanwhile, I also implement visual tracking algorithm for the robot, which allows it tracking and shooting its opposite without human control.
